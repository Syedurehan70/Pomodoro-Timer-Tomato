# Pomodoro-Timer-Tomato
This Project uses Tkinter GUI, in which i've created a tkinter window with Labels, Buttons, and Canvas which have a picture of tomato along with timer_text.

then positions it, gave buttons functions like, start_timer, reset, and count_down which sets the display of timer preventing it to overlap and showing float numbers.

It's a timer which runs which runs 25 mins work time, after every 25 mins there's a 5 min short break, and after 5 of these two timer completed we'll have a long-break timer.
